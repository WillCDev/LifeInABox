<p>
  Belfast doors left opened<br />
  The taste of cola cubes<br />
  The smell of school dinners<br />
  The feel of my hearing aid thumping against my chest skipping <br />
  Hopscotch in the playground <br />
  Egg and spoon races on school sports day <br />
</p>
<p>
  Playing houses with my best friend<br />
  Lifelong friendships pledged<br />
  Doctors and nurses and getting Wed<br />
  Swinging around lampposts <br />
  Roughness of rope on my hands <br />
  Twilight my mother calling me in for bed<br />
</p>
