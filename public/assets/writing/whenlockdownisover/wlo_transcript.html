When lockdowns over<br />
I want to go to the sea at Holywood<br />
Take a walk along the city streets<br />
Looking for bargains in charity shops<br />
Always wanting to sniff out a bargain at car boot sales<br />
Shopping for shoes<br />
All this seems like a pipe dream now<br />
Then I ask and I answer <i>“for now I will live in the land of my dreams”</i>
<br />
