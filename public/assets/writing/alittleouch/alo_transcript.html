  "Is this a good idea, this vaccine thing, what if I don't need it?" Crystal
  heard Casey say.
</p>
<p>
  After waiting frantically, it was time for Crystal, along with Casey to get
  their first vaccine, so Dugli was taking them to their doctor. He treated both
  humans and magical creatures, including a few magical animals. While Crystal
  was excited to get her first vaccine, as her best dragon-friend, Jessica had
  told her what it was like, Casey was the opposite. Her whiskers were twitching
  in anxiety and unfortunately she had left her Calm Gem at home.
</p>
<p>
  "Yes it is, it'll protect us from Dr Coronus's magic, plus we will be able to
  go outside again and be with our friends. Isn't that worth one little ouch,
  along with another one three weeks later?" Crystal replied.
</p>
<p>
  Dugli was impressed by his niece's thinking. He knew that she had stayed
  inside all this time, washing her magenta-furred hands to the point of
  hurting, along with Casey washing her paws. So the vaccine held the promise of
  freedom for them. So he got it, as he watched Crystal bend down and give her
  best friend a hug, remembering they'd ordered stuff from the comic-store which
  they were going to pick up later, at the shop door.
</p>
<p>
  "Maybe you should show her, getting a shot isn't so bad." Dugli whispered to
  his niece.
</p>
<p>A thought then entered Crystal's mind, why was her friend afraid?</p>
<p>
  "Because it might hurt, plus it might cause some side-effect, like a giant arm
  or giant paws." Casey confided.
</p>
<p>
  "I've gotten shots before, and despite being a goblin girl, I've never heard
  of any side-effects like that. Whoever told you it does that is dumb, trust
  me," Crystal assured her as it came to their turn. And then she had an idea,
  she would go first.Â  She saw that it was their doctor, kind Dr Peachblossom,
  asking Crystal, which arm she wanted the needle in. The left one she said.
</p>
<p>
  Casey was surprised when she saw it was a butterfly needle, not a big one,
  giggling at the funny face her friend was making while she got the injection.
  Crystal was so relieved after the needle came out and when her friend asked if
  she was alright and saw her nod, it made Casey feel brave enough.
</p>
<p>"You sure, what if it does what you think it does?" Crystal asked her.</p>
<p>
  "Watching you do it kinda helped, plus the face you were making was funny."
  Casey replied making Crystal and the doctor relieved. Asked which one of her
  furred arms she wanted the needle in, she chose the left one too. Feeling
  Crystal squeeze her paw gently, giggling at the expression on her furry face
  as she got the injection, Casey was relieved once the needle was out, despite
  feeling her arm was sore.
</p>
<p>
  Dugli was very happy, they had received their first vaccine and after a few
  weeks of waiting, they would get the second one. At least they would be
  mentally distracted until then, leaving the doctor's surgery, wearing their
  masks and heading off to collect their order from the comic-store.
