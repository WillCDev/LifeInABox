<p>
  “Once upon a time, there was a wee cat, with no name. She was so wee that she
  would have fitted into the palm of your hand! 
</p>
<p>
  And Brona and Hugh went to see Sam and David who grew her. Brona and Hugh
  didn’t know what the kitten was like. And all of a sudden a little fluffy ball
  came from the garden and jumped up on Brona’s lap!
</p>
<p>And Brona said ‘Hello’. And the little kitten said ‘Miaow, miaw’. </p>
<p>
  Hugh said ‘We’ll call her “Georgie”’ – because Hugh and Brona were football
  fans and George Best had died a few days previously.
</p>
<p>
  Brona said ‘I prefer the name “Jasmine”’, and the wee cat with no name said
  ‘Miaow’. Brona said ‘Is there anybody here called “Jasmine”?’, and Jasmine
  said ‘Miaow’!
</p>
<p>
  So, Jasmine came home with Brona and Hugh, and she was so scared because she
  didn’t know where she was, and she was with two people she didn’t know, and
  she didn’t know where her food was, or where her toilet was... She panicked
  and plopped all over Brona’s books! Then she hid under the sofa!
</p>
<p>
  When she came out, Brona and Hugh gave her a big cuddle and got her into her
  wee bed for a big snooze.
</p>
<p>
  Every morning, Hugh got up early and had cornflakes and then toast, while the
  girls lay on...
</p>
<p>
  ...until the toaster pinged! Up jumped Jasmine for toast with butter! Every
  morning Hugh gave Jasmine a slice of toast with butter and Jasmine would lick
  the butter off the toast, and then go back and lie down again with Brona.
</p>
<p>
  She knew that Hugh and Brona loved her so much. She was very happy. So, she
  was ready to go out into the garden and play. She jumped about in the grass,
  AND ALSO ATE THE FLIES – BUT WE DON’T MENTION THAT!
</p>
<p>
  Then Hugh got very very sick. He had to go away and go into the hospital. And
  he was so sick that he couldn’t come home ever again.
</p>
<p>
  Jasmine missed him. Brona missed him. And wee Jasmine brought in Hugh’s
  football shirt from the wardrobe in the other bedroom, and Brona cried with
  Jasmine.” The above is a story written by Brona which she always intended to
  finish but she never got around to it, not even when a friend offered her an
  opportunity to have it published on the Internet as a children’s story, but by
  that time she was very ill, and not able to cope with anything very much.
</p>
<p>
  Sadly – like Hugh twelve years previously – Brona got very very sick, and had
  to go away and go into the hospital, and was so sick that she couldn’t come
  home ever again.
</p>
<p>Jasmine misses her. I miss her.  </p>
<p>
  She was my closest friend for eleven years, and - as another friend put it -
  ‘my partner in crime’!
</p>
<p>
  We had many ups and downs. Many of the downs were due to an overload of
  stress, particularly from a system that is supposed to be there to help ill
  and disabled people like Brona, the inhumane Social Security system, made
  inhumane by the Conservative government’s austerity policy at the time. But
  even despite all the stress and all Brona’s illnesses, pains and difficulties,
  we had countless times which were among the best days of my life, and the most
  laughter I’ve ever had in my life. 
</p>
<p>
  I remember one warm summer’s evening, a few years ago, Brona and I were
  blowing bubbles in the garden for Jasmine to chase after and catch, special
  bubbles from the Pet Store for cats. One big bubble landed softly on the lawn
  without bursting, Jasmine slowly crept up on it, put her little nose to it and
  of course the fragile bubble burst. We laughed at the puzzled look on
  Jasmine’s face when  the bubble vanished into thin air and she couldn’t
  understand where it had gone, how it was there one moment and gone the next.
  Now, just a few summers later, and Brona has popped her clogs, vanished into
  thin air, and neither Jasmine nor I can understand where she has gone.
</p>
<p>
  I have known Jasmine almost since the day she came home with Brona and Hugh.
  Even though I didn’t know Brona particularly well at the time – just as a
  neighbour who had mostly been living in Canada for the previous seven or eight
  years – when Brona got Jasmine, she and Hugh came to my door to show me the
  little fluff-wuff, as Brona called her. Little did I know then, almost 16
  years ago, when Brona was just 39 years of age and Hugh 43, that Jasmine would
  outlive both of them, and that I would inherit Jasmine. 
</p>
<p>
  I got to know Jasmine very well during those years. As well as having to cope
  with my own grief when Brona died, almost two years ago now, I have also had
  to cope with Jasmine losing the love of her life. No matter how intense my
  grief has been, I nevertheless have other people in my life. Jasmine has
  nobody else, nobody close to her whom she trusts - except me, now that Brona
  is no longer in Jasmine’s life.  
</p>
<p>
  Jasmine, a Siamese, is a one-person cat. She was devoted to Brona, and has
  always kept her distance from everyone else. However, throughout all the
  years, apart from her total trust in Brona, Jasmine has trusted me more than
  anyone else. It was of some comfort to Brona to know that if she died before
  Jasmine (which she knew was likely) that I would look after Jasmine very well.
  Not only do I love Jasmine, I have the highest respect for her, for how good
  she was to Brona.
</p>
<p>
  Jasmine is a highly aware, emotionally intelligent, very sensitive cat, and
  shows all her feelings in her facial expressions and body language, as well as
  vocally, with numerous different types of meows signifying different things,
  not to mention her purrs. When she’s happy, you know it. When there’s
  something wrong, you know it. If she’s cross about something, you know it.
  When she likes you, you know it. Although throughout all the years when
  Jasmine had Brona, I was nowhere near as close to Jasmine as Brona was,
  nevertheless Jasmine and I have always had a great ability to communicate with
  each other, I have always been very adept at reading her body language, and
  Jasmine is highly intelligent and seemed to know this, and has always been
  able to communicate with me with ease, confident that I would easily
  understand.
</p>
<p>
  Jasmine clearly became sad when, in September [2019], after Brona had been
  gone for several days, there was no sign of her returning. At that time Brona
  was in hospital. When Brona died a few weeks later, it may have been that
  Jasmine sensed my grief and sadness, or that the length of time without Brona
  had increased, but Jasmine undoubtedly became sadder too. She was still a cat,
  and got on with the things cats do – eating, trotting about outside, sleeping
  – but she was a melancholy cat during that time, sleeping a lot, and
  definitely not the same happy cat she had been when Brona was with her. Brona
  often used to say that Jasmine was the purriest cat in Belfast, or Ireland, or
  the world, but not only did she not purr throughout September and October, she
  never meowed either – whereas normally, when she was with Brona, she was a
  very vocal cat – meowing to Brona a lot, every day, and occasionally giving me
  a meow.
</p>
<p>
  After a couple of months of silence, Jasmine came to understand that I was now
  her permanent caregiver, and she began to meow to me, which increased as the
  months went on. I had expected that Jasmine would look to me for comfort and
  affection, with Brona no longer in her life. But, whereas Jasmine trusted me
  to look after her, and showed appreciation for everything I do for her, as she
  always did, she wanted to keep her distance, she seemed to want to be a loner
  now, which was okay by me, if that’s what she wanted. If she sat in the same
  room as me, she would sit about two metres from me – months before social
  distancing became normal for the rest of us – rather than very close or on me.
  Jasmine’s vet, who visited in November, said that if a cat sits as close as
  two metres from you, that’s a sign that the cat likes you! When I stroked
  Jasmine, she would tolerate it for about 20 seconds, and then move away. The
  vet said that she would eventually bond with me, but, although he is a
  brilliant vet, I presumed he was wrong about that, and that Jasmine would
  rather be a loner for the rest of her life – with me just as a friend she
  trusts, at a bit of a distance, which was okay by me. She was still
  nevertheless a great companion, very lovable, often making me laugh, and
  aesthetically beautiful, with the way she moves so gracefully and her facial
  expressions.
</p>
<p>
  After six months of coping with grief, I was starting to get out more and
  becoming involved in more things which interested me, taking my mind off my
  sadness about Brona. And then came lockdown. The television coverage focussed
  a lot on people on ventilators in Intensive Care Units, which was what Brona
  went through, before she died. With that constant reminder, and all the time
  at home again, I experienced a return of a lot of grief. 
</p>
<p>
  But although there was talk about how difficult lockdown was for people living
  alone, I never felt I was living alone, I had Jasmine as a companion. I talk
  to Jasmine a lot, just as Brona did, even though Jasmine obviously doesn’t
  understand spoken language, but she understands the feelings behind words. And
  she does understand quite a few words, like the way dogs can. Brona used to
  joke about having to spell out the word ‘v-e-t’, because Jasmine understood
  the word ‘vet’! So, saying ‘thank you’ or ‘sorry’ to Jasmine feels a lot more
  sensible than saying those words to an inanimate object. But I talk to Jasmine
  about many things, including Brona.
</p>
<p>
  Living with a cat is very different from living with another human being, but
  it is also very different from living alone, especially with such a very aware
  cat as Jasmine.
</p>
<p>
  I remember remarking to myself, about 20 years ago, when I was living on my
  own at the time, that although I was in no way depressed and could be quite
  entertained by radio and television comedy programmes, I could go for days at
  home without ever laughing out loud. Brona totally changed that, she made me
  laugh out loud countless times a day, and Jasmine made us both laugh. And now
  still, even without Brona, Jasmine still makes me laugh out loud, every day. I
  once said to Brona that Jasmine makes us laugh in a different way every day.
  For a while we both agreed how true that was, and then later we agreed that it
  was an understatement! For reasons which it’s probably better not to even try
  to understand, cats are the funniest animals. And laughter is the best
  medicine. That, added to their lovableness, means cats are undoubtedly very
  therapeutic. Dogs are too, and Brona always said you don’t have to choose, you
  can love cats AND dogs, which she very much did. But cats are particularly
  funny, and their relationship to humans is unique. 
</p>
<p>
  Some of my favourite people don’t like cats. One of them, Brona's uncle,
  doesn’t like Jasmine and he complains that cats kill birds. I explained to him
  a few years ago when we were having a meal in a restaurant on Brona’s
  birthday, that although Jasmine brought in a few dead birds when she was a
  very young cat (and a few live birds which Brona rescued), she hasn’t brought
  in a bird for about eight or nine years. Brona's uncle then said that he has a
  large window in his house which, like a mirror, often has a reflection of the
  sky, and birds don’t realise it’s not the sky and they fly into the glass and
  get killed. I said to him, “So your window kills more birds than Jasmine!” He
  just looked at me with no answer, which Brona thought was hilarious. And then
  I went on to point out that every time he eats chicken or turkey, he is eating
  a bird which has been killed, not by a cat but by human beings, and far more
  birds are killed this way than by cats. And if you don’t like cats, that’s
  alright, but I hope you like mice and rats, because without cats there would
  be far more mice and rats in our neighbourhoods and homes than currently.
  Where we live, we never have any bother from mice or rats, so Jasmine and the
  other cats in the neighbourhood are doing a great and very worthwhile job.
</p>
<p>
  But cats (and dogs) are also great company, and for many single people living
  with a pet during lockdown, they have been invaluable. Throughout lockdown, I
  never felt I was at home on my own, because I was with Jasmine, a sensitive
  little soul - outside of the thoughts inside my head – to relate to, to attend
  to, who needs love and care, and relates back, and returns love and care, in
  her own way.
</p>
<p>
  Even with wanting to keep a bit of a distance from me, Jasmine doesn’t like
  being alone for too long. If I had been out for several hours, she always
  showed that she was pleased to see me home. I think - like for many pets -
  lockdown was a bonus for her, as I was at home almost all the time. So this is
  how it was at the beginning of lockdown, Jasmine and I had this understanding
  in our relationship, where she liked my company and appreciated all I did for
  her, but didn’t want me to come too close, just let her do her own thing.
</p>
<p>
  But then it all changed, within the space of just a few days – it may have
  been triggered by the stress of another cat in the neighbourhood – on several
  successive nights Jasmine had been coming in from outside meowing a lot as if
  there was something wrong, but I couldn’t figure out what, and then she would
  settle down and stop meowing after about five minutes, each time. And then one
  night my friend Genni, who lives in an apartment opposite me, said she saw
  Jasmine and another cat fighting in the courtyard, and then the next night
  Jasmine came in, again obviously a bit disturbed, and started rubbing herself
  against my legs, and she allowed me to pet her, and this went on for about
  twenty minutes! She kept diving against my legs, as if she was drunk! The next
  night, the same thing happened again, and as I stroked and petted her, I could
  hear her purring - for the first time in ten months, since Brona departed.
</p>
<p>
  This continued, but it wasn’t just when she came in at night after her
  confrontation with another cat, in the space of just a few days Jasmine went
  from wanting to keep her distance from me to not being able to get enough of
  me! After a couple of weeks she was no longer being disturbed by the other
  cat, they must have worked it out somehow. She started to sit on my lap, which
  she never did before, which she now loves more than anything, purring loudly,
  as I try to watch television but spend more time being entertained by Jasmine.
  At other times when I’m standing up, she looks like she is stuck to my legs,
  and sometimes if I need to go from one end of the room to the other, it can be
  quite a difficult task, as she dives in front of my legs with every step I
  take – which makes me laugh every time! And she sometimes follows me around
  now, whereas previously she was more inclined to go in the opposite direction,
  and she loves getting petted and stroked by me. 
</p>
<p>
  So the vet was right, she has bonded with me now, and she is an absolute joy –
  as she always has been, to me, and for 14 years to Brona. Her pedigree name is
  Saiwye Enchantress, and she enchanted Brona, and no doubt Hugh, and she
  continues to enchant me. She’ll be sweet sixteen next month, which apparently
  is quite old for a cat, but she has never had any illness, and she is as
  beautiful and healthy as she has ever been, showing no signs of age in either
  her demeanour or her movement, jumping up and over things and skipping off
  like a kitten at times.
</p>
<p>
  As I was writing this, I searched among the many notebooks Brona left, to see
  if she had written any more of her story about ‘the wee cat with no name’, I
  found no more of the story, but I found this poem, in a notebook for Ruth’s
  class in 2016, which expresses how I too feel about Jasmine:
</p>
<h2>My Darling - <i>by Brona Murphy</i></h2>
<p>Blue all-seeing eyes The colour largesse Of the skies.</p>
<p>Fleet of foot Agile and bouncy Especially on my head, in bed.</p>
<p>Big ears, never miss a trick She is not mute She is not thick</p>
<p>Loving furry softness Cuddly purry softness Gives out at decibels</p>
<p>
  Thinks she’s ‘all that’ Doesn’t know she’s a cat! I wonder too at times.
  Ethereal being, my darling pet.
</p>
