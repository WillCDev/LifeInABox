<p>
  Loneliness scares me.<br />
  Open myself up too much<br />
  To folk I don’t know.<br />
  A case of desperation,<br />
  Been alone for far too long.<br />
</p>
<p>
  No one to talk to.<br />
  Chuffed to talk to anyone.<br />
  Forget boundaries,<br />
  Confidentiality<br />
  Disappears out the window.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Shouldn’t take those risks<br />
  Take care who I tell things to<br />
  Keep my own counsel<br />
  Ask for help when I need it<br />
  A sign of strength not weakness.<br />
</p>
<p>
  I love solitude.<br />
  In my own thoughts, not lonely<br />
  In tune with the world <br />
  Quiet time for reflection<br />
  Restores my spirit and soul<br />
</p>
