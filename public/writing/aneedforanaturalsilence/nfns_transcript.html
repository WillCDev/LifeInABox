  Peace and Quietness I am quite addicted to Sounds I want to hear Of birds in
  trees singing loud Not human chat and traffic.
</p>
<p>
  Can’t be out too long Can’t control the outdoor sounds Cars beeping, men shout
  Confusing, conflicting ears  Brain can’t seem to process it.
</p>
<p>
  My cat’s deep purring Soothes me gently into sleep Humans can’t do that. Don’t
  mind her meows at all Beats a human nagging me.
</p>
<p>
  Free from human noise Hear the wind blow through the trees The breeze through
  the grass Even the cries of the gulls A calm voice whispers through these.
