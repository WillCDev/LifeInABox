<p>
  Peace and Quietness<br />
  I am quite addicted to<br />
  Sounds I want to hear<br />
  Of birds in trees singing loud<br />
  Not human chat and traffic.
</p>
<p>
  Can’t be out too long<br />
  Can’t control the outdoor sounds<br />
  Cars beeping, men shout<br />
  Confusing, conflicting ears<br />
  Brain can’t seem to process it.
</p>
<p>
  My cat’s deep purring<br />
  Soothes me gently into sleep<br />
  Humans can’t do that.<br />
  Don’t mind her meows at all<br />
  Beats a human nagging me.
</p>
<p>
  Free from human noise<br />
  Hear the wind blow through the trees<br />
  The breeze through the grass<br />
  Even the cries of the gulls<br />
  A calm voice whispers through these.
</p>
