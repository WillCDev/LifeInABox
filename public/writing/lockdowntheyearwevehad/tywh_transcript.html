  This time last year I was terrified. I was working in a charity shop. We were
  advised to wear gloves and wash our hands frequently because of the virus. The
  lack of knowledge about the virus was frightening. What were we dealing with?
  We didn't have to stay in the shop if we felt unsafe. I decided to go home, I
  was too anxious to stay around. I downed tools and said my goodbyes. When I
  got home, I just watched a box set on the TV. In a way you could say I was
  frozen with fear. Fear of the unknown. I remember it being a pretty turbulent
  week.

  On the Thursday the Day Centre sent us home. They told us life would be very
  different now for all of us and our families. On that Friday we all gathered
  for our Art Class. Halfway through the head of Open Arts came in and told us
  that our classes would be off for the foreseeable future. Classes would go
  online. I was in shock. All I could focus on was getting to Mum’s in
  Castlewellan. Once I was near family, I would feel safer. I don't remember
  much of the journey, but it was a relief to get out of Belfast into the
  countryside.
</p>

  While I was at Mum’s we went shopping. I panicked. There were huge queues at
  each checkout. Panic buying had begun. I didn't stay long at Mum’s. Plans were
  made for me to go to Dad’s in Holywood. I was relieved. I would settle in at
  Dad’s. It took me a while. My anxiety played up. I wouldn't leave the house
  unless someone came with me, but once I got over that, I started to develop a
  routine. I started to write, and I made connections with the groups online. I
  went for walks. I still had anxiety, but I was starting to cope better. But I
  was still a bit petrified about going into shops on my own.
</p>
<p>
  I spent the summer at Dad’s. I remember I sat in the garden a lot and
  connected with the Day Centre online. I joined in relaxation and did Jo Wickes
  Workouts. My dad helped me a lot with going online. I couldn't have done all
  the virtual stuff without him. Sometimes over lockdown I was difficult to
  manage as I have certain personality traits and behavioural issues. So, I'm
  thankful to Dad and Nola for really looking after me.

  Before the summer was out, I went to stay with Mum. Her partner Del painted
  the inside of my house. Mum and I gutted the house. There was an awful lot of
  junk I had built up over the years. One thing I regret from that time was not
  cleaning the house before Del arrived. He did it single handedly before he
  painted. I can't forgive myself. My excuse was I felt anxious. Now I know
  that's a cop out.
</p>
<p>
  I am spending the remainder of this lockdown at Mum’s. I still go online and
  do Creative Writing and Art. I'm much more settled here. I go out for walks
  every day. I still get anxious occasionally, but it's ok. I'm not scared in
  shops so much now. Masks and handwashing make me feel safer. Of course, the
  virus is airborne, but somehow a covering makes you feel cushioned. The
  vaccine is also a godsend.  I get my first injection on Tuesday, 16th March. I
  am relieved. What a year it's been. 
</p>
<p>
  I meant to mention that Mum and Del and me got the Covid virus in January. We
  all self-isolated for ten days. We each had different symptoms and it was
  awful. But we all recovered, and Mum has had her vaccine. Del is due his
  soon.

  During this year I have learnt a few things. I am now able to type on my
  computer and send stuff to my tutor. I can now take photographs and send them
  to my art tutor. I can now go for a walk on my own and even if I feel anxious,
  I can keep going. I learnt a lot about myself, and I learnt to live in a
  family again. It's not always rosy. You need to be patient and tolerant and
  respectful of others’ needs. You learn to love and appreciate your parents and
  their partners, no matter what they throw at you. You learn a lot from the
  older generation, especially not to sweat the small stuff. I think Ruth, my
  writing tutor would agree with that. What you mostly learn, above everything,
  is how lucky you are to be part of a family. Some people have no-one and are
  isolated in a flat with no going out space.
</p>
<p>
  This isn't the end of the story. There is more to come. I have to move back
  into my house in April. That's both exciting and daunting. I need to practise
  life skills. I have been cushioned and supported for a year. Now I need to be
  an adult in the real world. The real world with Covid 19. Be an adult learning
  to make adult decisions and living with Covid.
