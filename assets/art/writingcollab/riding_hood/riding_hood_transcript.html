  She is innocent,<br />
  She goes off into the woods,<br />
  She is wearing red shoes.<br />
  She meets friends her age in the forest,<br />
  She collects cones fallen from the trees,<br />
  She has a half basket full of cones.<br />
  She goes to Grainneâ€™s cottage,<br />
  For lunch bringing her friends,<br />
  To join her enjoyment of having lunch with people.<br />
