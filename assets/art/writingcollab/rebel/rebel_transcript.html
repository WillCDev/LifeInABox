<p>
  There’s a loner rebel<br />
  Who has stolen goods to sell<br />
  He robbed them from a train<br />
  Because he is insane.<br />
  He lives in the wilderness<br />
  Away from the law’s stress<br />
  He lives on the mountain<br />
  In a hut of battered tin.<br />
</p>
<p>
  One can’t really imagine<br />
  About his life of sin<br />
  He lives for tomorrow<br />
  Never has guilt or sorrow.<br />
  He’s a crook, not bold<br />
  Criminal until he’s old<br />
  Stashes all his gold<br />
  Mean & tight, living in mould<br />
  A sad story to be told.<br />
