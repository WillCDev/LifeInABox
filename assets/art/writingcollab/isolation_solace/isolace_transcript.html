<p>
  In this pandemic season<br />
  Imagination<br />
  Runs creatively quirky,<br />
  My mind is full of strange thoughts —<br />
  Ceiling cracks reveal<br />
  Imaginary road maps,<br />
  Blemishes become small islands,<br />
  Thoughts take fantasy journeys.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Look out the window —<br />
  I see faces in the clouds,<br />
  Family members looking down,<br />
  Know they’re looking out for me.<br />
  Thoughts of my past pets<br />
  Tucked up in those heavenly skies.<br />
  Looking around for Gina —<br />
  Here she is, safe with me,<br />
  I’m blessed with her company.<br />
