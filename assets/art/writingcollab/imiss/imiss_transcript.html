<p>
  What I miss is friends for coffee,<br />
  Meeting friends for lunch,<br />
  The freedom to shop whenever I wanted to,<br />
  I miss hugging friends for comfort.<br />
  I miss visiting the antique shops,<br />
  I miss going to Portrush meeting people there,<br />
  I miss socializing with people,<br />
  I consider this as a holiday.<br />
  To keep positive,<br />
  People are in the same boat,<br />
  Be appreciative that we have communication,<br />
  We still have mobile phones & email for contact.<br />
