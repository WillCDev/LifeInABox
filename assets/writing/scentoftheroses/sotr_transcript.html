<p>
  If I had known it was the last,<br />
  Scent of the roses,<br />
  From a broken vase.<br />
  Your dreams came a reality,<br />
  You inspire me,<br />
  You help me grow.<br />
</p>
<p>
  I follow the scent of the flower,<br />
  To move forward in life,<br />
  Suddenly I am alive again.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The thing is I am happy with you,<br />
  Forget I leave unhappiness behind,<br />
  What if youâ€™re the rose?<br />
</p>
