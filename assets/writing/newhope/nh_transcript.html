<p>
  A possible end to the crisis is coming,<br />
  Vaccines have been discovered.<br />
  Weâ€™re beginning to breathe again.<br />
  We may have to take it slowly,<br />
  Wait yet to open our doors,<br />
  Wait to relax the rules, but at last<br />
  The whole world will breathe a sigh of relief.<br />
</p>
<p>
  People will venture out again,<br />
  Visit their favourite places.<br />
  Businesses will finally open up.<br />
  Of course, it won't be all at once;<br />
  Gradual baby steps.<br />
  After all, the disease will still be with us.<br />
  It's been a long and arduous journey.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Darkness has covered us for months<br />
  The light is starting to shine through<br />
  There is new hope,<br />
  New optimism.<br />
  We are all waiting in the wings<br />
  The end to this waiting is nigh.<br />
</p>
