<p>
  I see a seagull on the horizon,<br />
  Its wings flap in the breeze<br />
  As it circles the air above the ocean.<br />
</p>
<p>
  I see it as it dives like a dart into the waves.<br />
  Seconds later it comes up to the surface,<br />
  Some poor morsel of fish caught in its hungry beak.<br />
</p>
<p>
  I see him as he scurries and flurries in the air<br />
  With his mates as they haggle for food.<br />
  I see him fly off into the distance,<br />
  Probably to pastures anew <br />
  On far off shores.<br />
